To Run Backend:
    1. start mongoDB server, using this command "sudo mongod"
    2. python run_backend_test.py to get the pretty-printed version of the page rank score generated from the links of each url in urls.txt

Public URL: http://ec2-34-227-172-22.compute-1.amazonaws.com/


Benchmark Result:

We observed that the processing time per request has increased compared to Lab 2. This is because the mongoDB performs disk reads for every query string.
